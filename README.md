# CarverDesignCloset
Mock up of a fullstack project allowing users to check out, check in, and add clothing items within a single web application. Uses a React frontend and Firebase as the backend  

(This was meant to be a demonstration of a possible web solution for a club in high school, and not meant for practical use.)
